# Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Power Usage Time Series

## Objective: 
To identify anomalies in an efficient and interpretable manner.
The time series dataset undergoes exploratory data analysis to understand its structure and descriptive statistics.
Missing data is imputed using interpolation techniques.
A n-dimensional dissimilarity matrix is constructed, and the multidimensional scaling (MDS) manifold technique is applied.
The resulting 2-D reduced data is subjected to clustering to identify outliers using probabilistic methods.
## Tools Used:
ipynb, pandas, scipy, sklearn, numpy, math, and matplotlib.

# Short-Term Load Forecasting (LSTM) in Power Usage Time Series
## Objective:
Mining large amounts of data provides valuable insights into peak demand periods.
The forecaster technique in TensorFlow is used with epochs = 15 and validation split = 2 to generate an LSTM forecast plot.
Dealing with high-dimensional and unlabeled data to provide accurate short-term forecasts (e.g., 1 hour).
## Tools Used:
TensorFlow, ipynb, pandas, scipy, sklearn, math, and matplotlib.
